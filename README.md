ok so here i will be writing it and i want to someone to make a program or make it into a code so ok (future: i just learned python, i am trying to replace some commands with these but some will not work because its python not noobie)

say = like print only in output
type = means for text that you can see like text

start os = on the start of os it can be changed to windows 11 fedora or pc if you're making boot loader and program if you're making program

then else elseif = i think you alredy know but elseif if the if don't works then elseif and if it is false then else

make = creates something like "make window "hi"" this command makes a window named hi the name is needed

ok thats all gonna make more in the future bye
